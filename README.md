## Question 1: Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

This section explores the use of the Isolation Forest algorithm for detecting anomalies in data. The key steps include:

- **Installing Libraries**: Ensuring all necessary libraries are installed.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Isolation Forest Implementation**: Applying the Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the Isolation Forest model.

## Question 2: Anomaly Detection with Time Series Forecasting

This section delves into the application of time series forecasting techniques to detect anomalies. It covers:

- **Data Preparation**: Structuring the data for time series analysis.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implementing models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for forecasting future values.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying anomalies based on deviations from forecasted values.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the forecasting models.

## Question 3: Identifying Time Periods with High Traffic Congestion

This section addresses the task of finding time periods with high traffic congestion. The steps include:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing traffic data to identify patterns.
- **Peak Detection**: Using statistical methods to find periods with unusually high traffic volumes.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the data to visually identify congestion periods.
